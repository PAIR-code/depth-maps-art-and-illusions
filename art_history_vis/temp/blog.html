  <p>
    Language is made of discrete structures, yet neural networks operate on continuous data: vectors
    in high-dimensional space. A successful language-processing network must translate this symbolic
    information into some kind of geometric representation—but in what form? Word embeddings provide
    two well-known examples: distance encodes semantic similarity, while certain directions
    correspond to polarities (e.g. male vs. female).
  </p>
  <h2>Representing Depth in Art</h2>
  <p>
    If you're going to embed a tree into Euclidean space, why not just have tree distance
    correspond
    directly to Euclidean distance? One reason is that if the tree has branches, it's impossible to
    do
    isometrically.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a tree has any branches at all, it contains a copy of this configuration, and can't be
    embedded isometrically either.
  </p>
  <h3>Linear Perspective</h3>
  <p>
    By contrast, squared-distance embeddings turn out to be much nicer—so nice that we'll give them
    a name. The reasons behind the name will soon become clear.
